A few notes on porting drivers, i.e. stuff we learned the hard way.

o Prefer spatch. If spatch won't work for some reason, ask the list.
  If it still doesn't work, see what version you have. 
  If it still doesn't work, then do a sed script
  Do the change manually only as a last resort. 

o Never change constants by hand. See the c/go pipeline in scripts/spatch/bsd
  Basically, you map a constant to an int, then back out to an Akaros constant

o Never #if 0 code you want to come back to later.
  These drivers tend to have #if 0 code and you'll forget which was yours.
  You can #if !ROS_KERN or better
  #ifdef PORT_ME_LATER or something odd enough to be noticed.

o If you can some wacky thing like this
  #define a(x) some_awful_cpp_code(x >> barf  | x << zong)
  Never do this:
   #define a(x) 0 // some_awful_cpp_code(x >> barf  | x << zong)
  it eats the rest of the line
  Never do this:
   #define a(x) 0 /* some_awful_cpp_code(x >> barf  | x << zong)*/
  Consider this:
   #define a(x) { assert(0); return 0;} /* some_awful_cpp_code(x >> barf  | x << zong)*/
  or similar. Make sure if the code is called, you will die.

o Single value per file found in bsd and linux
  Mistake. If you see it, find some way to transform it to plan 9 style ctl files.
